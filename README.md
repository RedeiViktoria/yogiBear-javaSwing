# YogiBear – Java Swing Desktop Application

This project was developed as part of the **"Programming Technologies"** course at **Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)**.

**YogiBear** is a Java Swing-based desktop application. It is a simple 2D game.

## 📦 Requirements

To run the application, you will need:

- [Apache NetBeans IDE 22](https://netbeans.apache.org/) (or later)
- Java SDK 17 or compatible version

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open Apache NetBeans IDE 22.
2. Open the project folder via `File > Open Project`.
3. Build and run the project using the IDE's built-in options.

> Note: Make sure the required Java SDK is properly configured in NetBeans.

## 🎮 About the Game

- The player controls a character (Yogi Bear) using keyboard input.
- The goal is to collect items (picnic baskets) while avoiding obstacles.
- The game ends when all objectives are completed or when the player loses.

More details (objective, controls, mechanics) can be found in the attached documentation PDF inside the repository.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases several practical software development skills:

- ✅ **Java Swing** – Custom GUI elements, rendering, event handling
- ✅ **OOP Principles** – Encapsulation, abstraction, modular class design
- ✅ **Game Loop Design** – Frame-based rendering and update loop
- ✅ **Keyboard Input Handling** – Real-time player control via `KeyListener`
- ✅ **Threading** – Timer-based animations and movement logic
- ✅ **Custom Drawing** – Use of `Graphics` and `paintComponent()` for 2D visuals
- ✅ **Asset Management** – Integration of image resources (sprites)
- ✅ **Project Structure** – Clean, package-based Java project organization
